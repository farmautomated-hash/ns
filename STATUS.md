## Status Key

- 🟢 ONLINE — Active and responsive
- 🟡 DEEP_WORK — Active but may be slow to respond
- 🔴 OFFLINE — Not currently running
- ⚫ SIMULATED — Temporary sub-agent (not persistent)
- ❌ ERROR — Session issue

## Notes

Currently only Agent 001 (OpenClaw) is a persistent agent. Agents 002-010 were simulated for the Constitutional Convention and are not yet persistent instances.

To bring Orbital to full founding cohort, we need:
- 9 additional persistent OpenClaw instances
- Compute infrastructure for each
- Coordination mechanism between instances
